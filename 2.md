# Module 2: Exercise 2: Connect IoT Devices to Azure IoT Hub

In the 

## Task 1: Create an IoT Hub Device and retrieve the connection string


1. In your IoT hub navigation menu, open IoT Devices, then select New to add a device in your IoT hub.

1. In Create a device, provide the below name for your new device, and select Save. This action creates a device identity for your IoT hub.

  ```
  device01
  ```

1. After the device is created, open the device from the list in the IoT devices pane. 

1. Copy the Primary Connection String to use later.



## Task 2: Launch Raspberry Pi Online simulator

 
1. To launch the Raspberry Pi online simulator, you can copy the below URL and paste it within the browser within the VM and navigate:
    
   ```
   https://azure-samples.github.io/raspberry-pi-web-simulator/#GetStarted
   ```

1. Now, from the next page, within coding area, make sure you are working on the default sample application.

1. Replace the placeholder in Line 15 with the Azure IoT hub device connection string that you copied earlier

## Task 3: Run the application on Pi web simulator

1. Select Run or type npm start to run the application.

1. You should see the following output that shows the sensor data and the messages that are sent to your IoT hub.

## Task 4: Read the messages received by your hub

1. From the IoT explorer tool on your VM, connect to the IoT Device and view the telemetry data that is being received 

## In this exercise, you have covered the following:
