# Module 2: Exercise 2: Connect IoT Devices to Azure IoT Hub

In the 

## Task 1: Create an IoT Hub Device and retrieve the connection string

1. Navigate to aiw-sap-iothub-<inject key="DeploymentID" /> resource group and  Select the iothub named iothub-<inject key="DeploymentID" /> .

1. On the **Create a device**, provide the below name for **Device ID** and leave other values as default then select **Save**. This action creates a device identity for your IoT hub.

  ```
  device01
  ```

## Task 2: Launch Raspberry Pi Online simulator

 
1. To launch the Raspberry Pi online simulator, you can copy the below URL and paste it within the browser within the VM and navigate:
    
   ```
   https://azure-samples.github.io/raspberry-pi-web-simulator/#GetStarted
   ```

1. Now, from the next page, within coding area, make sure you are working on the default sample application.

1. Replace the placeholder in Line 15 with the Azure IoT hub device connection string that you copied earlier

## Task 3: Run the application on Pi web simulator

1. Select Run or type npm start to run the application.

1. You should see the following output that shows the sensor data and the messages that are sent to your IoT hub.

## Task 4: Read the messages received by your hub

1. From the IoT explorer tool on your VM, connect to the IoT Device and view the telemetry data that is being received 

## In this exercise, you have covered the following:
 
   - O
   - E
