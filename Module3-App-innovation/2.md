# Module 3: App innovation

# Exercise 2: Use AI Builder to Create a collection and train the model

Duration: 45 minutes

## Overview

AI Builder is a Microsoft Power Platform capability that provides AI models that are designed to optimize your business processes. AI Builder enables your business to use AI to automate processes and glean insights from your data in Power Apps and Power Automate. With AI Builder, you can build custom models tailored to your needs, or choose a prebuilt model that is ready to use for many common business scenarios.

  > You can find complete information about AI Builder here: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ai-builder/overview`.

In this exercise, you will create, test, and train the model using AI Builder. Then, you will publish the model to make it available in the Power Apps environment.

This exercise includes the following tasks:

* Create and train a model using AI Builder
* Review and test the model
* Publish the model
 


## Task 2: Review and test the model

In this task, you will review the model which you created and trained in the previous task. You will also test the model manually to observe the behavior of it.

1. From the model's page, review the model which you created previously and click on **Quick test** under **Training document** to test the model manually.
