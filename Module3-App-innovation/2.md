# Exercise 2: Use AI Builder to Create a collection and train the model

Duration: 10 minutes

## Overview

AI Builder is a Microsoft Power Platform capability that provides AI models that are designed to optimize your business processes. AI Builder enables your business to use AI to automate processes and glean insights from your data in Power Apps and Power Automate. With AI Builder, you can build custom models tailored to your needs, or choose a prebuilt model that is ready to use for many common business scenarios.

  > You can find complete information about AI Builder here: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ai-builder/overview`.

In this exercise, you will review the traied and published model using AI Builder. Then, you will test the model manually to observe the behavior of it.

This exercise includes the following tasks:

* Review the pre-built AI Model and test  it.
 



## Task 1: Review the pre-built AI Model and test it  (Read-Only)

In this task, you will review the pre-built and trained model which extracts the data from the documents using AI Builder from the Power Apps portal.

1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to the below URL to open the Power Apps portal.
