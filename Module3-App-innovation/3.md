# Exercise 3: Create Flow to automate the process

## Overview

Power Automate is a tool that helps users create workflows between desired applications to synchronize files, get notifications, and collect data. This intelligent cloud-based solution uses triggers and actions to create chain reactions within a workflow so that repetitive, manual and time consuming tasks are accomplished without human intervention.

> You can find complete information about Power Automate here: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/`.

In this exercise, you will create a workflow to process information from the form using an AI model and add products to the catalog. The execution of workflow execution is described below.

1. Whenever a new mail arrives in the inbox, the workflow will be triggered and perform the below actions.
2. The AI model will be used by the flow to process the information from the mail.
3. The flow will send an email to you about the new product approval request.
4. Then, the flow will send an adaptive card to teams about adding a new product into the catalog.
5. You can either approve or reject the add new product request.

      -  If you **Approve** the request, the condition you have added in the flow will be true and a new product will be added to the catalog.  
      -  If you **Reject** the request, the condition will not be met and the product will not be added to the catalog.


> Info: A card is a user-interface (UI) container for short or related pieces of information. Cards can have multiple properties, attachments andcan include buttons which can trigger Card actions. Adaptive cards are a new cross product specification for cards in Microsoft products including Bots, Cortana, Outlook, and Windows. They are the recommended card type for new Teams development. You can find complete information about Adaptive cards here: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/what-are-cards`.
