# Module 3: App innovation

# Exercise 3: Create Flow to automate the process

Duration: 60 minutes

## Overview

Power Automate is a tool that helps users create workflows between desired applications to synchronize files, get notifications, and collect data. This intelligent cloud-based solution uses triggers and actions to create chain reactions within a workflow so that repetitive, manual, and time-consuming tasks are accomplished without human intervention.

> You can find complete information about Power Automate here: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/`.

In this exercise, you will create a workflow to process information from the form using an AI model and add products to the catalog. The workflow execution is described below.

1. Whenever a new mail arrives in the inbox, the workflow will be triggered and perform the below actions.
2. The flow will use an AI model to process the information from the document attached in the mail.
3. Next, the flow will trigger an action to send the Product Information to the Manager over email for approval.
4. Then, the flow will send an adaptive card to teams about adding a new product into the catalog.
5. You can either approve or reject the add new product request.

      -  If you **Approve** the request, the condition you have added in the flow will be true and a new product will be added to the catalog.  
      -  If you **Reject** the request, the condition will not be met and the product will not be added to the catalog.
