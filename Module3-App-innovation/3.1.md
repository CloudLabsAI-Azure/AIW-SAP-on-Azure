# Exercise 3: Create Flow to automate the process

Duration: 25 minutes

## Overview

Power Automate is a tool that helps users create workflows between desired applications to synchronize files, get notifications, and collect data. This intelligent cloud-based solution uses triggers and actions to create chain reactions within a workflow so that repetitive, manual, and time-consuming tasks are accomplished without human intervention.

> You can find complete information about Power Automate here: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/`.

In this exercise, you will import a workflow to process information from the form using an AI model and add products to the catalog. The workflow execution is described below.

1. Whenever a new mail arrives in the inbox, the workflow will be triggered and perform the below actions.
2. The flow will use an AI model to process the information from the document attached in the mail.
3. Next, the flow will trigger an action to send the Product Information to the Manager over email for approval.
4. Then, the flow will send an adaptive card to teams about adding a new product into the catalog.
5. You can either approve or reject the add new product request.

      -  If you **Approve** the request, the condition you have added in the flow will be true and a new product will be added to the catalog.  
      -  If you **Reject** the request, the condition will not be met and the product will not be added to the catalog.


## Task 1: Create Connections in Power Automate

Power Automate uses connections to make it easy for you to access your data while building flows. Power Automate includes commonly used connections, including SharePoint, SQL Server, Microsoft 365, OneDrive for Business, Salesforce, Excel, Dropbox, Twitter, and more. 

In this task, you will create connections in Power Automate and use them in the next task while building workflow.

1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to the below URL to open the Power Automate Portal.

   ```
   https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/
   ```
   
1. Click on the **Menu** icon which is present at the top left corner as highlighted below.

## Task 2: Import the workflow in Power Automate

In this task, you will import a workflow that processes information from the document by using an AI model, send the Product Information to the Manager over email for approval and add products to the catalog once the request is approved. This workflow will be used in the next exercise to send Product Information to the Manager.

> The workflow configuration file that will be imported has all triggers and actions pre-configured and provided in the lab environment. 

> If you wish to view how to configure the workflow from scratch then you can refer to the below link for detailed instructions on the configuration.
