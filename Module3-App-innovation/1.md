# Module 3: App Innovation

## Scenario
 
Contoso uses SAP Systems to store information related to the products they provide. Currently, the process to add a new product into the catalog is by first sending the Product Information to the Manager over email for approval. Once approved, the product details are entered manually into the catalog via SAP Fiori Web Application. Contoso now wants to get rid of this manual process and is looking for ways to do that.

Contoso has selected you to innovate and transform their manual business processes to digital, automated processes using Power Apps, Power Automate.

## Exercise 1: Create Power App and add Custom Connector to connect to SAP System

## Overview

Power Apps is a suite of apps, services, connectors, and data platform that provides a rapid application development environment to build custom apps for your business needs. Using Power Apps, you can quickly build custom business apps that connect to your business data stored either in the SAP System or in the underlying data platform (Microsoft Dataverse) or various online and on-premises data sources (SharePoint, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, SQL Server, and so on).

> You can find complete information about PowerApps here: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/powerapps/powerapps-overview`.

In this exercise, you will create a custom connector and Power App then add the custom connector to the app, which will be used to connect to your SAP System.

Here are the tasks you will be performing in this exercise:

  * Task 1: Create a custom connector
  * Task 2: Create Power App and add Custom Connector to SAP System
