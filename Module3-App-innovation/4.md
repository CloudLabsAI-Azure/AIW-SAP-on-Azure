## Exercise 4: Verify the workflow

In this exercise, you will trigger the workflow, approve the **Add new product** request and review the workflow run. You will also review the products that are added to the catalog by the workflow.


1. Within the Virtual Machine, open file explorer and navigate to this path **C:\LabFiles\Products**. 
 
1. Select the **Contoso-Product-07** pdf file from the list and review the content in the file.

   > Now, you will send an email that includes the document to the user account which you added while configuring the **When a new mail arrives** trigger so that new mail arrives in the inbox and workflow will be triggered.

1. Return to the browser tab in which outlook was open. If you have closed the tab, navigate to this URL `https://outlook.live.com/owa/` and click on **sign in** to sign in to your account.

1. You can use the below credentials to sign in to your account.

   * Email/Username: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>
   * Password: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

1. Now, send an email to the below user account by attaching **Contoso-Product-07** pdf file in the mail.

   * Email/Username: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>

1. Next, open the mail that is being triggered by the flow and review it.

1. Navigate back to the browser tab in which the Power automate portal is open. If you have closed the tab, you can navigate to this URL `https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/` to open the Power automate portal.

1. Return to the **Microsoft Teams** app and select **Chat** from the left-hand side menu.
 
1. Notice that workflow has sent an adaptive card request to the team's chat named **Flow** asking you for approval to add a new product to the catalog.

   >  You will be asked for approval for each product available in the document. Since there are 2 products available in the document that you have attached in the mail, you will receive 2 messages.
   >  You can either **Approve** or **Reject** the request.
      -  If you click on **Approve**, the condition you have added in the flow will be true and a new product will be added in the SAP system.  
      -  If you **Reject** the request, the condition will not be met and the product will not be added to the SAP system.

1. Click on **Approve** on the **Add new product request** message to approve the request for adding the first product.

1. Now,  you will receive another adaptive card asking you for the approval of the request to add a second product to the catalog.

1. On the second **Add new product request** message, click on **Reject** to reject the request.

   >  After approving/rejecting the request, you will receive a confirmation message which is being sent by the flow.

1. Next, return back to the Power automate portal and review that the run status changes to **Succeeded**. Open the flow and review it.

1. Return to the browser tab in which the SAP developer system was open. If you have closed the tab you can navigate to the below URL to open the  SAP developer system.

   ```
   https://sapes5.sapdevcenter.com/sap/bc/ui5_ui5/ui2/ushell/shells/abap/FioriLaunchpad.html#Shell-home
   ```
   
1. Then, click on the **Manage Products** tile and you will be redirected to a new view.

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M3-Ex1-flow-50.png?raw=true)

1. On the page that loads up, enter the Product ID **MS-UK-01 (1)** and click on the **Go (2)** button provided on the right side of the page, notice that the **product (3)** is added since you have approved the request for adding this product.

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M3-Ex1-teams-3.png?raw=true)

1. Now, replace the Product ID with this value **MS-US-02 (1)** and click on the **Go (2)** button. Notice that you will receive a message saying that **No data found** in the system, this is because the product is not being added to the list since we rejected the request.
