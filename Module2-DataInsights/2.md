# Module 2: Exercise 2: Connect IoT Devices to Azure IoT Hub

In the 

## Task 1: Create an IoT Hub Device and retrieve the connection string

1. Navigate to aiw-sap-iothub-<inject key="DeploymentID" /> resource group and  Select the iothub named iothub-<inject key="DeploymentID" /> .

1. On the **Create a device**, provide the below name for **Device ID** and leave other values as default then select **Save**. This action creates a device identity for your IoT hub.

  ```
  device01
  ```

## Task 2: Launch Raspberry Pi Online simulator

 
1. To launch the Raspberry Pi online simulator, you can copy the below URL and paste it within the browser within the VM.
    
   ```
   https://azure-samples.github.io/raspberry-pi-web-simulator/#GetStarted
   ```

1. On the **Overview of Raspberry Pi Simulator** pop-up, review the points and click on **x** to close it.

## Task 4: Read the messages received by your hub 

1. Launch the Azure IoT Explorer application by clicking on **Azure IoT Explorer** shortcut on the virtual machine desktop.

1. Click on **+ Add connection** on the IoT Hub pane.

1. Under the **Devices** pane you can see the **IoT devices** you have connected and registered in the previous task.

1. Click on **device01** from the list of Devices.

   This enables you to monitor the data being sent to the IoT hub. You are also verifying that the device is able to connect and communicate with your IoT hub.

1. Within 2-3 minutes you will receive telemetry data and you should be seeing messages displayed similar to the following: Take a look at sample data to review the temperature values.
