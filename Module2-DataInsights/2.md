## Task 2: Get familiar with GWSampleBasic Odata Service

OData is a REST-based protocol for querying and updating data. It provides a uniform way for both creating data and data models. You can find more references about OData from here: `https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/odata-01-intro-origins.html`

In this task, you will access the Sample service GWSAMPLE_BASIC which contains a list of collections such as ProductSet, SalesOrderSet, items of a sales order from the Enterprise Procurement demo, and view the sample data within the collection. 

1. Open a new browser tab within the virtual machine and navigate to the following URL to connect to the GWSample_Basic Service which is an OData Service and view the collections.

    ```
    https://sapes5.sapdevcenter.com/sap/opu/odata/iwbep/GWSAMPLE_BASIC/
    ```

1. You can see that the dataset returns all the different collections like **ProductSet (1)** and **SalesOrderSet (2)**. 

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M2-Ex2-salesorderdata-1.png?raw=true)

1. Now, navigate to the following URL to view the sales order dataset which you will later connect to and retrieve the information.

    ```
    https://sapes5.sapdevcenter.com/sap/opu/odata/iwbep/GWSAMPLE_BASIC/SalesOrderSet?(%270500000001%27)/ToLineItems
    ```
    
1. You can see the data that is displayed and review the data available in the sales order dataset.

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M2-Ex2-salesorderdata.png?raw=true)
   
1. Now, navigate to the following URL to view the ProductSet dataset which you will later connect to, and retrieve the information regarding a product and add a new product.

    ```
    https://sapes5.sapdevcenter.com/sap/opu/odata/iwbep/GWSAMPLE_BASIC/ProductSet
    ```

1. From the data that is displayed, you can find different products that already exists within the dataset.

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M2-Ex2-salesorderdata-2.png?raw=true)

1. Now, we will connect to the Fiori Launch Pad Interface in the SAP developer system where already four applications are deployed by navigating to the below URL:

   ```
   https://sapes5.sapdevcenter.com/sap/bc/ui5_ui5/ui2/ushell/shells/abap/FioriLaunchpad.html#Shell-home
   ```
  
1. Then, click on **Manage Products** tile and you will be redirected to a new view.

   > Info: SAP Fiori is based on HTML Javascript

1. In the page that loads up, you can click on **Go** button provided on the right side of the page.

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M2-Ex2-salesorderdata-4.png?raw=true)

   > Info: Once you click on Go, it will display a list of products within the ProductSet Dataset and it uses OData to connect to the underlying SAP System which contains the ProductSet DataSet.
