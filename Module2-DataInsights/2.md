# Module 2: Exercise 2: Connect IoT Devices to Azure IoT Hub

In the 

## Task 1: Create an IoT Hub Device and retrieve the connection string

1. Navigate to aiw-sap-iothub-<inject key="DeploymentID" /> resource group and  Select the iothub named iothub-<inject key="DeploymentID" /> .

1. On the **Create a device**, provide the below name for **Device ID** and leave other values as default then select **Save**. This action creates a device identity for your IoT hub.

  ```
  device01
  ```

## Task 2: Launch Raspberry Pi Online simulator

 
1. To launch the Raspberry Pi online simulator, you can copy the below URL and paste it within the browser within the VM.
    
   ```
   https://azure-samples.github.io/raspberry-pi-web-simulator/#GetStarted
   ```

1. On the **Overview of Raspberry Pi Simulator** pop-up, review the points and click on **x** to close it.
