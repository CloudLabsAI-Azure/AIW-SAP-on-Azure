# Module 2: Exercise 3: Connect IoT Devices to Azure IoT Hub


## Task 1: Review the existing IoT Hub and retrieve the connection string

IoT Hub is an Azure service that enables you to ingest high volumes of telemetry from your IoT devices into the cloud for storage or processing. You can find more references about IoT Hub from here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/about-iot-hub.

In this task, you will explore through the existing IoT Hub and retreive the connection String of Iothub.

1. Return back to the Azure Portal, if not already open you can navigate to this url ```https://portal.azure.com``` to open Azure portal.

3. Navigate to aiw-sap-iothub-<inject key="DeploymentID" /> resource group and Select the iothub named iothub-<inject key="DeploymentID" /> .

1. From the iothub **Overview** tab, scroll down and review the available options.

1. Now, copy the **Iothub Connection string** value from below and paste it in the notepad as you will need this value in the next steps to establish a connection between the **IoT hub** and **Azure IoT Explorer**.

    **Iothub Connection string** : <inject key="IotHubConnectionString" />  

## Task 2: Register a device for Pi in your IoT hub. 

1. From the IoT hub navigation menu Select **IoT Devices** under **Explorers**, then select **New** to add a device in your IoT hub.

1. On the **Create a device**, provide the below name for **Device ID** and leave other values as default then select **Save**. This action creates a device identity for your IoT hub.

  ```
  device01
  ```

1. After the device is created, open the device **device01** from the list in the IoT devices pane.

## Task 3: Launch Raspberry Pi Online simulator

 
1. To launch the Raspberry Pi online simulator, you can copy the below URL and paste it within the browser within the VM.
    
   ```
   https://azure-samples.github.io/raspberry-pi-web-simulator/#GetStarted
   ```

1. On the **Overview of Raspberry Pi Simulator** pop-up, review the points and click on **x** to close it.

## Task 4: Run the application on Pi web simulator

1. Select Run or type npm start to run the application.

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M2-Ex2-simulator-3.png?raw=true)

1. You should see the following output that shows the sensor data and the messages that are sent to your IoT hub.

## Task 5: Read the messages received by your hub 

1. Launch the Azure IoT Explorer application by clicking on **Azure IoT Explorer** shortcut on the virtual machine desktop.

1. Click on **+ Add connection** on the IoT Hub pane.

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M2-Ex3-iotexplorer.png?raw=true)

1. On the **Add connection string** blade, enter the **Connection string** value of IoT Hub which you noted earlier. 

   >**Note**: You can find the **Connection string** value at **IoTHubConnectionString** under **Environment Details** tab at the right of the workspace.
   
1. Click on **Save**

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M2-Ex3-iotexplorer-2.png?raw=true)

1. Under the **Devices** pane you can see the **IoT devices** you have connected and registered in the previous task.

1. Click on **device01** from the list of Devices.

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M2-Ex3-iotexplorer-3.png?raw=true)

1. Select **Telemetry** from the left-hand side menu and click on the **Start** option.

   This enables you to monitor the data being sent to the IoT hub. You are also verifying that the device is able to connect and communicate with your IoT hub.

1. Within 2-3 minutes you will receive telemetry data and you should be seeing messages displayed similar to the following: Take a look at sample data to review the temperature values.
