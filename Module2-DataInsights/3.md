# Module 2: Exercise 3: Connect IoT Devices to Azure IoT Hub

## Scenario
 
One of the core functions of Contoso's vaccine supply chain is to keep vaccine products properly refrigerated along every step in their journey. They are required to maintain proper temperatures for products that cannot tolerate excessive heat, especially in places with extremely hot climates, unreliable connections to electricity, and weak transportation infrastructure. Temperature monitoring is a critical thing for Contoso to assess vaccine handling quality, detect malfunctioning equipment, and understand if it has negatively impacted vaccine potency and safety.

For this, Contoso has included IoT devices with temperature sensors in each package. Contoso is allowing you to connect those devices in an Azure IoT Solution and retrieve the temperature readings from the package.


## Overview

IoT Hub is a managed service, hosted in the cloud, that acts as a central message hub for bi-directional communication between your IoT application and the devices it manages. You can use Azure IoT Hub to build IoT solutions with reliable and secure communications between millions of IoT devices and a cloud-hosted solution backend. You can connect virtually any device to IoT Hub. You can find more references about IoT Hub from here: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/about-iot-hub`.

In this exercise, you will connect to the Azure IoT Hub device and start sending telemetry data from the device to Azure IoT Hub. You will also review the telemetry data that is being sent to IoT Hub using Azure IoT Explorer


This exercise includes the following tasks:

* Review the existing IoT Hub.
* Register a device in your IoT hub.
* Launch Raspberry Pi Online simulator.
* Run application on the Pi web simulator.
* Review the telemetry data from Azure IoT Explorer.

## Task 1: Review the existing Azure IoT Hub

In this task, you will explore through the existing IoT Hub and retrieve the connection String of IoT Hub.

1. Return to the browser tab in which Azure Portal is open. If you have closed the tab, navigate to the URL ```https://portal.azure.com``` to open the Azure portal.

3. Navigate to aiw-sap-iothub-<inject key="DeploymentID" /> resource group and select the iothub named iothub-<inject key="DeploymentID" /> .

1. From the IoT hub navigation menu, select **Shared access policies** to review the available policies.

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M2-Ex3-iothub-1.png?raw=true)

1. Now, select **iothubowner** policy from the list.

1. On the **iothubowner** policy blade, review the **Primary Connection String** value by selecting the eyeball icon next to the value. You will use this connection string value to establish a connection between the **IoT hub** and **Azure IoT Explorer** to view the telemetry data.

## Task 2: Create a device identity for existing Azure IoT hub.

In this task, you will create a device identity in the identity registry in your Azure IoT hub. A device cannot connect to a hub unless it has an entry in the identity registry. For more information, you can refer to the IoT Hub developer guide `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-identity-registry`.

1. From the IoT hub navigation menu Select **IoT Devices (1)** under **Explorers**, then select **+ New (2)** to add a device in your IoT hub.

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M2-Ex2-iothubdevice.png?raw=true)

1. On the **Create a device**, provide the below name for **Device ID** and leave other values as default then select **Save**. This action creates a device identity for your IoT hub.

   ```
    device01
   ```
  
   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M2-Ex2-iothubdevice-1.png?raw=true)

1. After the device is created, open the device **device01** from the IoT devices pane.

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M2-Ex2-iothubdevice-2.png?raw=true)

1. On the **device01** IoT Hub blade, review the details of the device.
 
1. Now, copy the **Primary Connection String** value to notepad as you will need this value in the next task to connect to your IoT Hub device.

## Task 3: Connect IoT device to Azure IoT Hub

In this task, you will use the Raspberry Pi online simulator instead of a real IoT device and connect to the existing Azure IoT Hub.
 
1.  Within the virtual machine, navigate to the below URL to launch the Raspberry Pi online simulator.
    
    ```
     https://azure-samples.github.io/raspberry-pi-web-simulator/#GetStarted
    ```

1. On the **Overview of Raspberry Pi Simulator** pop-up, review the points and click on **x** to close it.

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M2-Ex2-simulator-1.png?raw=true)

1. Replace the **[Your IoT hub device connection string]** placeholder in Line 15 with the Azure IoT hub device connection string that you noted earlier to connect to the IoT Hub device and send data to IoT Hub.

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M2-Ex2-simulator-2.png?raw=true)
   
   > In the next task, you will run the simulator and send data to Azure IoT Hub.

## Task 4: Run application on the Pi web simulator

In this task, you will run the Raspberry Pi online simulator which will sensor data to IoT Hub and view the sensor data that is being sent to IoT Hub. 

1. Select **Run** to run the application.

   > You can also type **npm start** to run the application.

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M2-Ex2-simulator-3.png?raw=true)

1. You should see the following output that shows the sensor data and the messages that are sent to your IoT hub.

## Task 5: Explore sensor data being received by Azure IoT Hub in Azure IoT Explorer

In this task, you will use the Azure IoT Explorer to review the telemetry data sent by the simulated IoT Hub device to Azure IoT Hub.

1. Launch the Azure IoT Explorer application by clicking on **Azure IoT Explorer** shortcut on the virtual machine desktop.

1. Click on **+ Add connection** on the IoT Hub pane.

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M2-Ex3-iotexplorer.png?raw=true)

1. On the **Add connection string** blade, enter the **IoT Hub Connection string** value to establish a connection between the **IoT Hub** and **Azure IoT Explorer**. You can find the connection string value below.

    **Iothub Connection string** : <inject key="IotHubConnectionString" />
    
   >**Note**: You can also find the **Connection string** value at **IoTHubConnectionString** under **Environment Details** tab.
   
1. Click on **Save**

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M2-Ex3-iotexplorer-2.png?raw=true)

1. Under the **Devices** pane you can see the **IoT devices** you have connected and registered in the previous task.

1. Click on **device01** from the list of Devices.

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M2-Ex3-iotexplorer-3.png?raw=true)

1. Select **Telemetry (1)** from the left-hand side menu and click on the **Start (2)** option.

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M2-Ex3-iotexplorer-4.png?raw=true)

   This enables you to monitor the data being sent to the IoT hub. You are also verifying that the device can connect and communicate with your IoT hub.

1. Within 2-3 minutes you will receive telemetry data and you should be seeing messages displayed similar to the following: Take a look at sample data to review the temperature values. 
    
   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M2-Ex3-iotexplorer-5.png?raw=true)
  
1. Once you have verified that the IoT hub is receiving the telemetry from the device01 device, press **Stop** and then close **Azure IoT Explorer** application.
