# Module 3: Cloud Operations, Governance, Security

# Exercise 4: Azure Backup for SAP  

SAP HANA databases are mission-critical workloads that require a low recovery point objective (RPO) and a fast recovery time objective (RTO). SAP HANA databases can be backed up by running on Azure VMs using Azure Backup.

Azure Backup is Backint certified by SAP, to provide native backup support by leveraging SAP HANA’s native APIs. This offering from Azure Backup aligns with Azure Backup’s model of zero-infrastructure backups, eliminating the need to deploy and manage backup infrastructure. SAP HANA databases can now seamlessly backup and restore running on Azure VMs (M series VMs also supported now!) and leverage enterprise management capabilities that Azure Backup provides.

In this exercise, you will review the pre-deployed Recovery Services vault that is being used to store the recovery points that are created over time. You will then review the pre-created private endpoints that are required for performing the backup. Then, you will review the SAP HANA databases that are being backed up to the recovery service vault. You will also review the SAP HANA database that are being restored from the recovery service vault.

This exercise includes the following tasks:

  * Review the Recovery Service Vault
  * Review the existing Private Endpoints
  * Discover the SAP HANA databases
  * Configure backup
  * Review the SAP HANA databases that are backed up to Recovery Service Vault
  * Restore DB from Recovery Service Vault

## Task 1: Review the existing Recovery Service Vault

A Recovery Services vault is an entity that stores recovery points created over time. It also provides an interface to perform backup-related operations such as on-demand backups, performing restores, and creating backup policies.

> You can find more references about Recovery Service Vault from here: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-recovery-services-vault-overview`

In this task, you will review the per-deployed Recovery Services vault that is being used to store the recovery points that are created over time.

1. Navigate back to the **SAPHANARG** resource group and select the **Recovery Service Vault** resource named **SAPHANARecoveryvault**.

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M3-p2-Ex4-recoveryvault-18.png?raw=true)

1. On the **Overview** blade of SAPHANARecoveryvault, review the information about the recovery service vault.

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M3-p2-Ex4-recoveryvault-17.png?raw=true)

1. In the above steps you have reviewed the pre-deployed recovery service vault, you can find the instructions below to create a new recovery service vault.

   > **Note**: Below instructions are read-only, as the provided lab environment doesn't have the required permissions to create the recovery service vault resource.

1. From the Azure portal, search for **Recovery Services vaults** and select it from the list.

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M3-p2-Ex4-recoveryvault-1.png?raw=true)

1. Click on **+ New** on the **Recovery Services vaults** blade, to create the resource.

1. On the **Basics** tab, under **Project details** enter the following information.

    1. **Subscription**: Select your subscription from the dropdown.
    2. **Resource Group**: Select your resource group from the dropdown.

1. Enter the below value in the **Vault name** field.

   ```
   SAPHANAvault
   ```
    
1. For the **Region** field, select the same region as the resource group.

1. After adding all the values, the final screenshot will look like this.

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M3-p2-Ex4-recoveryvault-2.png?raw=true)

## Task 2: Review the existing Private Endpoints

## Task 2.1: Enable Managed Identity for your vault

In this task, you will verify the status of managed identities for the recovery service vault that allows it to create and use private endpoints that are required for backup.

1. Select **Identity** under **Settings** from the left-hand side menu of the recovery service vault.

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M3-p2-Ex4-recoveryvault-6.png?raw=true)

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M3-p2-Ex4-recoveryvault-7.png?raw=true)

## Task 2.2: Review the Private Endpoints

Private endpoints allow you to connect securely from servers inside a virtual network to your Recovery Services vault. The private endpoint uses an IP from the VNET address space for your vault. The network traffic between your resources inside the virtual network and the vault travels over your virtual network and a private link on the Microsoft backbone network. This eliminates exposure from the public internet.

> You can find more references about Private Endpoints from here: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/private-endpoints`

In this task, you will review the pre-configured private endpoint that are used to securely back up and restore the data from the Recovery Service vault.

1. Select **Private endpoint connections** under **Settings** from the left-hand side menu of the recovery service vault.

   ![](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-SAP-on-Azure/blob/main/media/M3-p2-Ex4-endpoint-1.png?raw=true)
