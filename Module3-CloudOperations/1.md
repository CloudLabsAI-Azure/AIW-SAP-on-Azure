# Module 3: Cloud Operations, Governance, Security

# Exercise 1:	Getting started with the environment

## Overview

In this exercise, you will review the pre-deployed SAP HANA resources. You will also connect to the SAP HANA database and verify the status of the database.

Following are the resources that are pre-configured for SAP on Azure monitoring and management:

   - **Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions** to monitor SAP HANA and SQL systems.

   - **Virtual Machine** that has SAP HANA database installed on it.

   - **Azure Site Recovery** to monitor and maintain disaster recovery service health for SAP application servers.

   - **Azure Backup service** to protect your SAP HANA database.

   - **Azure Monitor**  to monitor the associated SAP resources (Virtual Machine that has SAP HANA database installed) and perform the configured actions like triggering alerts based on the alert rules.

This exercise includes the following tasks:

- Review the pre-deployed SAP HANA resources.
- Verify SAP Hana Status
