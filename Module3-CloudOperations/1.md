# Module 3: Cloud Operations, Governance, Security

# Exercise 1:	Log in to Hana VM and verify Hana Status 

## Overview

SAP S/4HANA Cloud is a complete enterprise resource planning (ERP) system with built-in intelligent technologies, including AI, machine learning, and advanced analytics. It helps companies adopt new business models, manage business change at speed, orchestrate internal and external resources, and use the predictive power of AI. Benefit from tight, native integration between processes, industry depth, and a consistent in-memory data model. 

SAP S/4HANA on Azure offers:

- Seamless connectivity for end users who need to access SAP Fiori-based applications when using Azure ExpressRoute.
- A 99.99 percent SLA for your critical ERP instances by running all product instances of SAP S/4HANA in a high-availability pair by running in two Azure Availability Zones.
- Backup for SAP S/4HANA in seconds, with a low recovery-time objective even for multi-terabyte databases.
- Certification that SAP S/4HANA runs on SUSE Linux Enterprise and Red Hat Enterprise Linux servers. SAP HANA on Azure Virtual Machines and SAP HANA on Azure large-instance machines are certified to run SAP S/4HANA.

The pre-deployed SAP S/4HANA solution include the following Azure resources:

1. A **Linux Virtual Machine** that has SAP HANA multi-tenant database installed in it.
2. A **Windows Virtual Machine** that contains pre-configured and activated SAP S/4HANA Fiori UI in client 100, with prerequisite components activated in the solution, that acts a front end for accessing the SAP HANA database.

   > **SAP Fiori** is a new user experience (UX) developed by SAP based on User Interface UI5 and OData services. It enables employees to work with SAP simply, quickly, and easily by eliminating the complexities involved in the SAP Landscape

## Task 1: Log in to Azure Portal and verify the resources.

1. Review the existing resource groups and resources available in the resource groups.

## Task 2: Log in to Hana VM and verify Hana Status 

In this task, you will connect to the SAP HANA VM and verify the status of SAP HANA database.
   
1. Select the resource group named **SAPCAL-UniqueId** from the list.

1. Review the available resources and select the virtual machine named **saphanademo-Win1**.

1. From the overview blade, copy the **Public IP address** of the virtual machine that will be used to connect to it.

1. Now, search for the **Remote Desktop Connection** App and then select it. 

1. Paste the **Public IP address** in the Computer field and then, click on **Connect**. 

1. Now, enter the below credentials to connect to the VM. Make sure you add dot and back-slash **“.\”** before the Admin username. 

    - **VM Admin username**: Administrator
    - **password** : Password#1219
  
1.  Click on **Ok** button to establish connection to the VM. 

1. Next, click on the **Yes** button to accept the certificate and add in trusted certificates.  
  
1. Launch the **HANA Studio** application by clicking on the HANA Studio shortcut on the SAP HANA virtual machine desktop.
