# Exercise 3: Azure Security Center for SAP 

## Overview

Azure Defender is a built-in tool that provides threat protection for workloads running in Azure, on premises, and in other clouds. Integrated with Azure Security Center, Azure Defender protects your hybrid data, cloud-native services, and servers and integrates with your existing security workflows, such as SIEM solutions and vast Microsoft threat intelligence, to streamline threat mitigation.

> You can find more references about **Azure Defender** from here: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/azure-defender`

In this exercise, you will enable Azure Defender for SAP HANA VM's and review the alerts fired by Azure Monitor and details of the alert.
