# Module 3: Cloud Operations, Governance, Security

# Exercise 3: Azure Security Center for SAP 

## Overview

Log alerts allow users to use a Log Analytics query to evaluate resource logs every set frequency and fire an alert based on the results. Rules can trigger one or more actions using Action Groups. You can find more references about Log alerts from here: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-log`

In this exercise, you will review the alerts fired by Azure Monitor and details of the alert.
