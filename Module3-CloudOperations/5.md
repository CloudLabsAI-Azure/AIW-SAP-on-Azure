SAP HANA (High-Performance Analytic Appliance) is an In-Memory Database that uses technology based on column-based, row-based, and object-based database technology. It uses In-Memory computing to write, read and store the data in RAM, rather than processing on normal disk drives. It can be deployed on-premise and cloud.

An SAP on Azure Advanced Specialization assures potential customers that a partner meets the highest standards for service delivery and support, and increases partner visibility through prioritized ranking in searches and referrals via solution provider.

SAP HANA databases are mission-critical workloads that require a low recovery point objective (RPO) and a fast recovery time objective (RTO). Using **Azure Backup** solution to backup and restore SAP HANA databases, have the following advantages:

- **15-minute Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Recovery of critical data of up to 15 minutes is possible.
- **One-click, point-in-time restores**: Restore of production data can be done on alternate HANA servers. The chaining of backups and catalogs to perform restores is all managed by Azure behind the scenes.
- **Long-term retention**: For rigorous compliance and audit needs. Backups can be retained for years, based on the retention duration, beyond which the recovery points will be pruned automatically by the built-in lifecycle management capability.
- **Backup Management from Azure**: Use Azure Backup’s management and monitoring capabilities for improved management experience. Azure CLI is also supported.
