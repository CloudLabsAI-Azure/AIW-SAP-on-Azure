# Module 3: Cloud Operations, Governance, Security

# Exercise 2:	Configure Azure Monitor for SAP  

## Overview

Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions is an Azure-native monitoring product for customers, running their SAP landscapes on Azure. With Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions, customers can collect telemetry data from Azure infrastructure and databases in one central location and visually correlate telemetry data for faster troubleshooting. It read the SAP data available in the Log Analytics and makes data available for the workbooks to show it graphically.

> You can find more references about Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions from here: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/azure-monitor-overview`

In this exercise, you will review the pre-deployed **Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions** resource that monitors the SAP HANA instances. You will then review the **SAP HANA provider** that is being added to the Azure Monitor. The SAP HANA provider connects to the SAP HANA database, pulls telemetry data from the database, and pushes it to the Log Analytics workspace. You will review the CPU and memory metrics of the SAP HANA instances that are being monitored. You will also review the pre-configured action groups and alert rules.

This exercise includes the following tasks:

  * Review the existing Azure Monitor for SAP
  * Review the existing Key vault
  * Review the pre-configured SAP HANA Provider
  * Review Azure Monitor Dashboard
  * Review the pre-configured Alert rules
