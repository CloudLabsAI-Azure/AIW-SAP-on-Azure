# Module 3: Cloud Operations, Governance, Security

# Exercise 2:	Configure Azure Monitor for SAP  

## Overview

Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions is an Azure-native monitoring product for customers, running their SAP landscapes on Azure. With Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions, customers can collect telemetry data from Azure infrastructure and databases in one central location and visually correlate telemetry data for faster troubleshooting. It read the SAP data available in the Log Analytics and makes data available for the workbooks to show it graphically.

> You can find more references about Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions from here: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/azure-monitor-overview`

In this exercise, you will review the pre-deployed Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions resource that monitors the SAP HANA instances. You will then review the SAP HANA provider that is being added to the Azure Monitor. The SAP HANA provider connects to the SAP HANA database, pulls telemetry data from the database, and pushes it to the Log Analytics workspace. You will review the CPU and memory metrics of the SAP HANA instances that are being monitored. You will also review the pre-configures action groups and alert rules.

This exercise includes the following tasks:

  * Review the existing Azure Monitor for SAP
  * Review the existing Key vault and Secret
  * Review the pre-configured SAP HANA Provider
  * Review Azure Monitor Dashboard
  * Review the existing Alert rules

## Task 1: Review the existing Azure Monitor for SAP

In this task, you will review the **Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions** resource to monitor the SAP HANA instances.

1. Navigate back to the browser tab in which Azure Portal is open and select **SAPHANARG** resource group from the list.

1. Select the **Azure Monitor for SAP Solutions** resource named **SAPMonitor**.

1. On the **Overview** blade of **SAPMonitor**, review the information about the Azure Monitor.

1. Now, click on **X** to close the **Overview** pane of SAPMonitor resource.

## Task 2: Review the existing Key vault and Secret

In this task, you will review the pre-created key vault and secret that stores the SAP HANA database password. The secret will be used to access the SAP system securely.

1. Navigate back to **SAPHANARG** resource group and select the key vault named **SAPHANAKeyvault** from the list of resources.

1. On the **Overview** blade of **SAPHANAKeyvault** resource, review the information about the key vault.

## Task 3: Review the pre-configured SAP HANA Provider

In this task, you will review the **SAP HANA** provider that is being added to the Azure Monitor to enable data collection from the SAP HANA database. The SAP HANA provider connects to the SAP HANA database over SQL port, pulls telemetry data from the database, and pushes it to the Log Analytics workspace.

> Info: The SAP HANA provider collects data every 1 minute from the SAP HANA database.

1. Navigate back to the **SAPHANARG** resource group and select the resource **SAPMonitor**.

1. Select **Providers** under **Settings** from the left-hand side menu.
