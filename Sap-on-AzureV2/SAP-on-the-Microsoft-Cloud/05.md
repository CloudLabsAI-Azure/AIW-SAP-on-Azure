# Exercise 5: Predict Incoming Cashflow

Azure Machine Learning is a cloud service for accelerating and managing the machine learning project lifecycle. Machine learning professionals, data scientists, and engineers can use it in their day-to-day workflows: Train and deploy models, and manage MLOps. To learn more about Azure Machine Learning refer: `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/overview-what-is-azure-machine-learning`

In this exercise, you will be reviewing the pre-deployed **Automated ML Run** and **best-trained model** that predicts incoming cash flow based on historical payment delays for previous sales. You will also test the best model using the **SalesPaymentFull** data which is the integrated data of **SalesOrdersHeaders** and **Payments** and also you will review the test end results.

The best model is selected based on the error between the predicted **Payment Offset** and the **Actual offset**. The model with the least error is selected. You can find more refernces about how automated ML works from here: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-automated-ml#how-automated-ml-works`
 
This exercise includes the following tasks:

1. Review the Automated ML Run and best-trained Model
2. Test the Payment Delay/Offset Prediction

### Task 1: Review the Automated ML Run and best-trained model

In this task, you will be reviewing the pre-deployed **Automated ML Run** and **best-trained model** that predicts incoming cash flow based on historical payment delays for previous sales.

1. Navigate to the **aiw-sap-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** resource group in the Azure portal and open the Azure Machine Learning workspace named **asamlworkspace<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** from the resources list.

### Task 2: Test the Payment Delay/Offset Prediction

In this task, you will test the best trained model and review the results.

1. Navigate to **Endpoints** **(1)** section from left-menu, select **aciservicename** **(2)** under **Real-time endpoints**.

   ![](media/auto-ex5-t2-step1.png)
   
2. On the **aciservicename** endpoint screen, select the **Test** **(1)** tab. Select the editor type as **JSON editor** **(2)**. Replace the contents of the input data with the below-given code **(3)** and select **Test** **(4)**. Verify the **Test result** **(5)**.

   >**Info :**  
   - Here, you will be using the SalesPaymentFull data for testing the best model.
   - SalesPayementFull is the combined data of SalesOrdersHeaders and Payments data.
   - SalesPayementFull table is created and published in the Synapse Workspace as a part of pre-requisits.

  >**Info : **

  - In this exercise, you have used the best model to forecast the Payment delay in days for SalesOrderHeaders data.
  - To forecast the Payments that have been paid for SalesOrderHeaders data, we integrated the SalesOrderHeaders and Payments data and created a new view called **SalesPaymentFull**.
  - As part of the pre-requisite, the SalesPaymentFull View has been already created and published in the Synapse Workspace.

       - To explore on SalesPaymentFull view, navigate to synapse workspace-> click on Data ->click on Workspace- >and select sapdatasynsql SQL database. You will see the created dbo.SalesPaymentsFull view under **Views**.

  - In the above step, you have inserted the values of SalesPaymentsFull to test the best model.
  - Once, the test has been run successfully, you were provided with the values in the Test result box.
  - These values will include the **predicted payment delay in days** for SalesOrderHeaders data.


## Summary

In this exercise, you have covered the following:

* Reviewed the Automated ML Run and best-trained model.
* Tested the best-trained Model and reviewed the results.
