# Exercise 5: Predict Incoming Cashflow

Azure Machine Learning is a cloud service for accelerating and managing the machine learning project lifecycle. Machine learning professionals, data scientists, and engineers can use it in their day-to-day workflows: Train and deploy models, and manage MLOps. To learn more about Azure Machine Learning refer: `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/overview-what-is-azure-machine-learning`

In this exercise, you will be reviewing the pre-deployed **Automated ML Run** and **best-trained model** that predicts incoming cash flow based on historical payment delays for previous sales. You will also test the best model and review the results.

This exercise includes the following tasks:

1. Review the Automated ML Run and best-trained Model
2. Test the Payment Delay/Offset Prediction

### Task 1: Review the Automated ML Run and best-trained model

1. Navigate to the **aiw-sap-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** resource group in the Azure portal and open the Azure Machine Learning workspace named **asamlworkspace<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** from the resources list.
