# Exercise 6: Import a workflowâ€¯to export the PowerBI Sales report and Share it with Teams

## Overview

Power Automate is a tool that helps users create workflows between desired applications to synchronize files, get notifications, and collect data. This intelligent cloud-based solution uses triggers and actions to create chain reactions within a workflow so that repetitive, manual, and time-consuming tasks are accomplished without human intervention.

> You can find complete information about Power Automate here: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/`.

In this exercise, you will establish connections for Power BI, One Drive for Business, Approvals, Microsoft Teams, and Encodian in Power Automate. You will also import and trigger a flow to export the Power BI report and share it with Teams. The workflow execution is described below.

  * Whenever you trigger the flow manually, the flow will export the report from **Power BI Workspace** to PDF format.
  * Now, the flow will convert the Power BI report from PDF to PNG format.
  * In the next step, it will send an approval request to **Approver** to share the Power BI report with Teams.
  * You can either approve or reject the request to share Power BI reports with Teams.
     - If you **Approve** the request, the condition you have added to the flow will be true and the Power BI report will be shared with Microsoft Teams.
     - If you **Reject** the request, the condition will not be met and the report will not be added to the Teams.
  

### Task 1: Create Connections in Power Automate

Power Automate uses connections to make it easy for you to access your data while building flows. Power Automate includes commonly used connections, including SharePoint, SQL Server, Power BI, Microsoft 365, OneDrive for Business, Approvals, Encodian, Salesforce, Excel, Teams, Dropbox, Twitter, and more.

In this task, you will create connections in Power Automate and use them in the next task while building workflow.

   ```
   https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/
   ```
   
1. Now, select the **Sign in** option from the right-top to sign in to the Power Automate Portal.
