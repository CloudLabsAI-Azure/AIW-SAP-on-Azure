# Azure Virtual Workshop: SAP on Azure

## Overview

SAP on Azure solution helps you optimise your Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) in the cloud using the security features, reliability, and scalable SAP-certified infrastructure of Azure.

When managing a global, distributed supply chain and manufacturing environment, companies face challenges with constrained bandwidth, latency issues, and massive volumes of data that can adversely influence execution and quality scenarios.

SAP uses Microsoft Azure to run these solutions in a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model that can help reduce the customer’s need to manage the software and underlying infrastructure while accelerating the time to value of supply chain applications. Customers will be able to scale globally by leveraging Azure which offers enterprise-grade compute, storage, and network services to support mission-critical performance and business continuity to run SAP Digital Supply Chain solutions.


## Hands-on Labs Scenario

For the lab, let’s consider Contoso which is a large company that handles logistics. Currently, in an effort to keep up with the global crisis with the supply of vaccinations, Contoso is responsible for shipping vaccines across the world. Such a massive scale of logistics is often challenged by various factors, one of which is the time constraints and maintaining the correct temperature (30 degrees) of the storage containers, exciding that will result in wastage of the vaccine.

Hence, one of the core functions of Contoso's vaccine supply chain is to maintain the temperature threshold of the vaccine containers and stabilize the temperature along every step of the entire transition. They are required to maintain the proper temperature for products that cannot tolerate excessive heat, especially in places with an extremely hot climate, unreliable connections to electricity, or poor transportation infrastructure. Temperature monitoring is a critical thing for Contoso to assess vaccine handling quality, detect malfunctioning equipment, and understand if it has negatively impacted vaccine potency and safety.

To tackle this, Contoso has included IoT devices with temperature sensors in each package. Contoso allows you to connect to those devices in an Azure IoT Solution and retrieve the temperature readings from the package which will be then used to monitor or to place a replacement order for any vaccine that gets damaged.

## Lab Context

Contoso wants to make sure that the vaccine is not exposed to unstable temperatures as that will result in irreversible damage to the vaccines. So, Contoso requires a way to monitor the temperature data generated by the built-in sensors and evaluate if the vaccine needs to be replaced in case the temperature goes above 30°. Contoso wants an order to be placed automatically to replace the damaged vaccine in case the measured temperature goes above 30°.

To achieve these requirements, you will be configuring a route in the Azure IoT Hub to direct the messages to the service bus queue as soon as the temperature reaches 30° or more. Then you will configure a Logic App to be triggered by a Service Bus queue which will send an e-mail notification to you whenever a message is added to the queue and automatically creates a sales order in the SAP system.

You will also enable viewing the current sales orders in Excel, PowerBI, Outlook, and Teams.

Below is the diagram of the **Solution architecture** that you will implement in this lab.
