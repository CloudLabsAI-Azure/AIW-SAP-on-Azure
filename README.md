# Azure Immersion Workshop SAP on Azure

## Overview

SAP on Azure solutions help you optimise your enterprise resource planning (ERP) in the cloud using the security features, reliability and scalable SAP-certified infrastructure of Azure.

When managing a global, distributed supply chain and manufacturing environment, companies face challenges with constrained bandwidth, latency, and massive volumes of data that can adversely affect execution and quality scenarios.

SAP will use Microsoft Azure to run these solutions in a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model that can help reduce the customer’s need to manage the software and underlying infrastructure while accelerating time to value of supply chain applications. Customers will be able to scale globally by leveraging Azure which offers enterprise-grade compute, storage, and network services to support mission-critical performance and business continuity to run SAP Digital Supply Chain solutions.



## Hands-on Labs Scenario

The following labs provide you a quick and easy way to get started with SAP on Azure. 

For the purposes of these exercises, let’s consider Contoso is a large shipping company. 

They are in charge of shipping the vaccines across the world. The vaccines will not be useful if the temperature of the storage containers exceeds 30 degree.

Contoso has already included the temperature sensors within the packages.

In order to help Contoso to monitor the shipping packages, you will retrieve the data from the sensors and monitor it.

If the temperature goes above 30°, the vaccine is damaged and must be replaced

To replace the vaccine, a sales order is automatically created in SAP ECC in case the measured temperature is above 30°

For excel users the current sales order SAP ECC will be displayed in Excel
